To achieve the described requirements, we'll be using the Bogus library to generate synthetic data and CsvHelper library to write the data into CSV files. Here's how to do it:

Setup:
First, you'll need to install the required NuGet packages:

mathematica
Copy code
Install-Package Bogus
Install-Package CsvHelper
Code:
Here's a C# code to generate synthetic data as described:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Globalization;
using System.IO;
using Bogus;
using CsvHelper;

namespace TestDataGenerator
{
    public class Title
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string TitleName { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }
        public string AgeCertification { get; set; }
        public int Runtime { get; set; }
        public List<string> Genres { get; set; }
        public string ProductionCountry { get; set; }
        public int? Seasons { get; set; }
    }

    public class Credit
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public int TitleId { get; set; }
        public string RealName { get; set; }
        public string CharacterName { get; set; }
        public string Role { get; set; }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
                .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
                .RuleFor(t => t.TitleName, f => f.Lorem.Sentence(3))
                .RuleFor(t => t.Description, f => f.Lorem.Sentence(15))
                .RuleFor(t => t.ReleaseYear, f => f.Random.Int(1900, DateTime.Now.Year))
                .RuleFor(t => t.AgeCertification, f => f.PickRandom(
                    new[] { "G", "PG", "PG-13", /*... other certifications ...*/ "TV-MA" }))
                .RuleFor(t => t.Runtime, f => f.Random.Int(60, 240))
                .RuleFor(t => t.Genres, f => f.Make(3, () => f.Random.Word()).ToList())
                .RuleFor(t => t.ProductionCountry, f => f.Address.CountryCode())
                .RuleFor(t => t.Seasons, f => f.Random.Bool(0.8) ? (int?)null : f.Random.Int(1, 10));

            var creditsFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
                .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
                .RuleFor(c => c.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(0, 99))  // Assuming we have 100 titles
                .RuleFor(c => c.RealName, f => f.Name.FullName())
                .RuleFor(c => c.CharacterName, f => f.Name.FullName())
                .RuleFor(c => c.Role, f => f.PickRandom(
                    new[] { "Director", "Producer", "Actor", /*... other roles ...*/ "Music Composer" }));

            var titles = titlesFaker.Generate(100);
            var credits = creditsFaker.Generate(150); // More than titles as multiple credits can be related to one title

            using (var writer = new StreamWriter("titles.csv"))
            using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
            {
                csv.WriteRecords(titles);
            }

            using (var writer = new StreamWriter("credits.csv"))
            using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
            {
                csv.WriteRecords(credits);
            }
        }
    }
}
Notes:
I assumed the movies/series genres to be a random word since you didn't provide specific genres.
Similarly, I picked a random country code for the ProductionCountry field. If you want specific countries, you can replace the random choice with a list of desired countries.
I've given a 20% chance for a title to be a series (having seasons) and 80% chance for it to be a movie (no seasons). Adjust this ratio as needed.
You can modify the range and types of the data to match your exact testing scenarios.
Once the code is executed, you'll have two CSV files (titles.csv and credits.csv) containing the synthetic data.

Please create new array of strings for this data
ChatGPT
If you want to use predefined arrays of strings for specific fields like genres, age certifications, roles, and country codes, here's how you can modify the provided code:

csharp
Copy code
//... [rest of the code]

class Program
{
    // New arrays of strings for specific fields
    private static readonly string[] Genres = { "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Mystery", "Romance", "Thriller", "Sci-Fi" };
    private static readonly string[] AgeCertifications = { "G



User
here is a data G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA
ChatGPT

2 / 2

Certainly! Here's the modification to the code using the provided data for the age certifications:

csharp
Copy code
// ...

class Program
{
    // New arrays of strings for specific fields
    private static readonly string[] Genres = { "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Mystery", "Romance", "Thriller", "Sci-Fi" };
    private static readonly string[] AgeCertifications = { "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA" };
    // ... [rest of the arrays]

    static void Main()
    {
        var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
            // ... [rest of the rules]
            .RuleFor(t => t.AgeCertification, f => f.PickRandom(AgeCertifications)); // Use the provided array for AgeCertification

        // ... [rest of the code]
    }
}

// ... [rest of the code]
With this change, the generated AgeCertification values for the titles will be picked from the provided array of age certification options.

There should be relationships between  Title.Id and Credit.TitleId
ChatGPT
Got it. To ensure a relationship between Title.Id and Credit.TitleId, we can modify the code such that for every Title, we generate associated Credits. This guarantees that every title will have corresponding credits. Here's how to do it:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Globalization;
using System.IO;
using Bogus;
using CsvHelper;

namespace TestDataGenerator
{
    public class Title
    {
        // ... [properties as before]
    }

    public class Credit
    {
        // ... [properties as before]
    }

    class Program
    {
        private static readonly string[] Genres = { "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Mystery", "Romance", "Thriller", "Sci-Fi" };
        private static readonly string[] AgeCertifications = { "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA" };
        private static readonly string[] Roles = { "Director", "Producer", "Screenwriter", "Actor", "Actress", "Cinematographer", "Film Editor", "Production Designer", "Costume Designer", "Music Composer" };
        
        static void Main()
        {
            var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
                // ... [rest of the rules]

            var creditsFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
                .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
                .RuleFor(c => c.RealName, f => f.Name.FullName())
                .RuleFor(c => c.CharacterName, f => f.Name.FullName())
                .RuleFor(c => c.Role, f => f.PickRandom(Roles));

            var titles = titlesFaker.Generate(100);
            var credits = new List<Credit>();

            foreach (var title in titles)
            {
                var numOfCredits = new Random().Next(1, 5); // Randomly choose 1 to 5 credits per title
                for (var i = 0; i < numOfCredits; i++)
                {
                    var credit = creditsFaker.Generate();
                    credit.TitleId = title.Id;
                    credits.Add(credit);
                }
            }

            using (var writer = new StreamWriter("titles.csv"))
            using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
            {
                csv.WriteRecords(titles);
            }

            using (var writer = new StreamWriter("credits.csv"))
            using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
            {
                csv.WriteRecords(credits);
            }
        }
    }
}
Now, the code will generate between 1 and 5 Credit entries for each Title, ensuring that every Title has associated Credits with the correct relationship between Title.Id and Credit.TitleId.




User
I need Title.Id starts from 1 not from 0
ChatGPT
Understood. You can achieve this by using f.UniqueIndex + 1 for the Id rules in the Faker definitions. This way, the index starts from 1 instead of 0.

Here's the modification for that:

csharp
Copy code
var titlesFaker = new Faker<Title>()
    .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex + 1)
    // ... [rest of the rules]

var creditsFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
    .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex + 1)
    // ... [rest of the rules]
With this change, both the Title.Id and Credit.Id will start from 1.
